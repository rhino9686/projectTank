## Project Tank: 
### The Lil' Tanks Themselves

![Webp net-resizeimage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41589697/57890693-86e80400-7806-11e9-8d56-a8f19770ed18.jpg)


This was our final project for EECS 373. We made two remote-controlled tanks, armed with IR lasers and receivers, that could be controlled by two players and shoot at each other in a real-time arcade style match. The tanks communicated over the SPI and UART protocols for most of their connections, which are:
- XBee Radios
- Receivers for PS2 controllers
- IR sensors and emitters
- Speaker modules
- Servo motors for wheel movement and turret movement

## Installation:
Be advised that this software was designed for a tank enclosure desgined and constructed from scratch, and is not worth installing unless you have experience with Libero and Softconsole, and have a programmable SmartFusion Chip available. If you want to, then just clone the repo or download all the files (LARGE download). The directory for the GUI and Server are found on https://github.com/rhino9686/projectTank-Display and https://github.com/rhino9686/projectTank-Server.

For future EECS 373 students at Michigan, know that using this software in any way for projects may constitute a violation of the Honor Code.

## The Good stuff
All the C code is in SoftConsole/turret_servo_mss_design_MSS_CM3_0_app/main.c.

All the Hardware/Verilog is in hdl/
